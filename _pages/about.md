IT is not for the faint of heart. It takes a special person to make a career out of IT. That's where my story begins. My career path started in the IT industry, not becaues of passion or calling, but because of opportunities available. I've always had an affinity to computers, and to technology in general. The aspects of IT come easy to me (except certificates.. I **loathe** certificates). After 6 years in IT, I felt that I hit a plataeu, both with my role in IT (helpdesk) and opportunities availalbe. So I did what no one does: I changed careers, and took a job making minimum wage...  
  
Yep, that's right, I changed careers. I attended Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) school to pursue the career path of becoming a firefighter. It's a simple 5 step process (varies by region):  
  
- Step 1: Get EMT certification
- Step 2: Work as EMT
- Step 3: Get paramedic certification
- Step 4: Attend firefighter academy
- Step 5: Get hired at fire department
  
So there I was, nearly a year after leaving IT for firefighting. Curently working on step 3. I landed a highly coveted EMT position with a revered fire department in San Diego County. I had the opportunity to drive ambulances for the fire department, respond to 911 calls and treat critically ill/injured patients. I began to realize that becoming a fire fighter was *almost* my dream job. A veteran engineer of the fire department gave me invaluable advice. He said, "the fire department isn't a fraternity, it's a sorority." For reasons I won't get into, that nugget of wisdom hit home in more ways than one. I made the difficult decision to return to IT.  
  
Extraordinary luck struck again when I landed a job as the Senior IT Administrator at GovX. Not only did I run the IT department, I **was** the IT department. This was a significant step up for me in IT. As IT Admin, I was given ownership of all things IT within the company. For the first time ever, I was in the position to make the changes needed. After my stint in the fire department, a huge sense of relief came over me when I was able to say, "I think I could do this for 30 years." Little did I know that this job would expose me to a platform that would change my career trajectory forever.  
  
Microsoft Azure. I'm confidently passionate about Azure. After receiving certifications for AZ-900, then AZ-104, I'm hungry for more. This site is a way for me to document and share my journey with others.
