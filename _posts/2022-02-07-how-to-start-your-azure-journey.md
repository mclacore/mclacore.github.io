*“Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.”*  
– **Henry Ford**  
  
The hardest part about making a change is to start. Approaching the idea of working with Azure is no different. If you have no prior cloud experience, it's understandable to look at cloud platform giants, like Azure or AWS, and feel as if you're looking up at Mount Everest from the bottom. So how do you climb this behemoth of a cloud provider? The same way you would with Mount Everest. There are many routes up to the top. Some routes are more difficult than others, depending on your background. As you climb, the size of the mountain seems smaller, and the top of the mountain seems not so far away. The same can be said for starting in Azure or AWS: the more you're doing it, the more it seems like you can do this.

## Certifications

### Are certifications worth it?
I think so. Certifications, for any job field, aren't a guarantee that you know every single aspect of the role. However, they are proof that you understand the theory or concepts required. Is it possible to get a job like Azure Solutions Architect without the certification? Yes, it is, but you need to make up for the lack of a certification with extensive and verifiable experience. In my opinion, certifications aren't required, just recommended.  
  
### Should I get AZ-900?
I have the AZ-900 certificaiton, and I can vouche that it doesn't help or hurt you when getting a job, unless that's your only certification. If your goal is DevOps Engineer or Architect, AZ-900 is a personal choice. If you're unsure if you'll even like Azure, or you have no idea what Azure is about and what it offers, then AZ-900 may help you. The 900 series certifications with Azure and Microsoft are really meant for you to test your basic understanding on a topic for your own benefit and confidence. An employer could not care less if you had AZ-900, as long as you're clearly qualified for the job you're applying to. But if you want to earn AZ-900 to gain some confidence or test the waters, by all means, go for it.  
  
## Learning the material  
  
### Where can I go to learn Azure?
[Microsoft's Learn modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) are one of the best resources for learning Azure. They're organized well with learning paths created for any goal you might have related to Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365, etc. Options are limitless. The modules are structured so you just follow along the reading material. Many of the modules also contain sandbox mode, which require you to create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), so you can practice creating and using Azure resources in a guided learning environment.  
  
### What about courses/practice exams?
There are tons of paid courses and practice exams out there for you to look into, if that's how you prefer to learn. I do **encourage caution** as you may come across scam courses that provide the wrong answers, or exam dumps disguised as courses. There are free courses out there too. [John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpIn7ox7j7bH_OFj7tYouOQ) releases amazing content frequently, and organizes his video playlists for specific certification paths or topics.  
  
There are a plethora of resources available that can guide you through the journey of working within Azure, both paid and **free**. Consume the materials at your own pace or consume them within a structured class. There's really no reason why you can't learn Azure if that's what you really want to do.  
  
So, what's stopping you? Start climbing.
